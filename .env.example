VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here

# Notes:
# - These are TEST environment credentials by default
# - For production, you'll need to switch to Amadeus PRODUCTION credentials
# - Never commit your .env file to version control
# - The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose these to the frontend
# - Store production secrets in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

# Security Reminders:
# ⚠️ NEVER commit .env to git (it's in .gitignore)
# ⚠️ NEVER share your API keys publicly
# ⚠️ Rotate keys if accidentally exposed
# ⚠️ Use different keys for dev/staging/production
#
# 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE (as of 2026-01-18):
# The current architecture exposes API secrets client-side (VITE_ prefix).
# This is a SEVERE security vulnerability. Users can extract credentials from:
# - Browser DevTools
# - Compiled JavaScript bundles
# - Network requests
#
# RECOMMENDATION: Move all Amadeus API calls to a backend/serverless function.
# Options: Cloudflare Workers, Netlify Functions, Vercel Serverless, Express backend

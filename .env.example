# Squad Flight Finder - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# Amadeus API Credentials
# Get your credentials at: https://developers.amadeus.com/
# 1. Sign up for a free account
# 2. Create a new app
# 3. Copy your API Key and Secret below

VITE_AMADEUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Notes:
# - These are TEST environment credentials by default
# - For production, you'll need to switch to Amadeus PRODUCTION credentials
# - Never commit your .env file to version control
# - The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose these to the frontend
# - Store production secrets in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

# Security Reminders:
# ⚠️ NEVER commit .env to git (it's in .gitignore)
# ⚠️ NEVER share your API keys publicly
# ⚠️ Rotate keys if accidentally exposed
# ⚠️ Use different keys for dev/staging/production

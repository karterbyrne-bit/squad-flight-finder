## Risks & Mitigations

### Revenue Risks

**Risk 1: Low Booking Conversion**
- **Mitigation:** Test multiple affiliate partners, optimize CTA placement, A/B test booking flow
- **Fallback:** Focus on subscription revenue instead

**Risk 2: Low Premium Conversion**
- **Mitigation:** Test pricing, add more Pro features, improve free-to-paid funnel
- **Fallback:** Lower price point to £4.99/month or add ads to free tier

**Risk 3: High Churn Rate**
- **Mitigation:** Improve product stickiness, add saved trips, email engagement, retention campaigns
- **Fallback:** Focus on annual plans (lower churn), add more lock-in features

**Risk 4: Amadeus API Costs**
- **Mitigation:** Aggressive caching, smart limiting, negotiate volume discounts
- **Fallback:** Switch to alternative APIs, implement tiered API usage (free users limited)

### Market Risks

**Risk 1: Competitor Copies Fairness Feature**
- **Mitigation:** Move fast, build brand loyalty, add more features, patent algorithm (optional)
- **Fallback:** Compete on execution and user experience

**Risk 2: Low Market Demand**

- Profitable by Month 6-9

**Use of Funds:**

# Squad Flight Finder: Short-Term Monetization Strategy

**Version:** 2.0 (Revised)
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Time-Limited Opportunity

---

## ⏰ The AI Agent Timeline

**Reality check:** ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity will add real-time flight search within 12-24 months. When they do, users will just say "find me fair flights for my group from London, Manchester, and Edinburgh to somewhere warm in March" and get results instantly.

**Your window:** 12-18 months to build, ship, monetize, and exit before AI agents commoditize this entire category.

**This is NOT a long-term business. This is a time-limited opportunity to make £5K-20K on a side project.**

---

## Executive Summary

Squad Flight Finder has a unique feature (group fairness) in a competitive market, with a limited time window before AI agents make standalone tools obsolete.

**Strategy:** Ship fast (3 months), monetize simple (affiliates + ads), maximize revenue (12-18 months), exit before AI agents kill it.

**Realistic Outcome:**
- **Pessimistic:** £1K-3K total, learning experience
- **Realistic:** £5K-10K total, decent side hustle
- **Optimistic:** £15K-30K total, great side income
- **Home run:** £50K-100K acquisition by OTA

**Time investment:** 200-400 hours over 12-18 months
**Expected hourly rate:** £10-50/hour (if it works)

## Revenue Model: Keep It Simple

### Affiliate Commissions (80% of revenue)

**How it works:**
1. User searches for flights
2. Clicks "Book on Skyscanner" button
3. You earn commission if they book
4. That's it. No complexity.

**Realistic projections:**

**Year 1 (12 months):**
- 500-1,000 total users by end of year
- 3% booking conversion = 15-30 bookings total
- 4 people per booking × £10 commission = £600-1,200
- **Total: £600-1,200**

**If you hustle (SEO, content, viral):**
- 2,000-3,000 users
- 4% conversion = 80-120 bookings
- **Total: £3,200-4,800**

**Implementation:**
- Week 8-10: Apply to Skyscanner, Booking.com, Expedia
- Week 11-12: Add "Book Now" buttons
- That's it. Don't overcomplicate.

### Display Ads (20% of revenue)

**How it works:**
1. Add Google AdSense code (10 minutes)
2. Place 2-3 ads (header, sidebar, between results)
3. Earn £5-15 per 1,000 page views
4. That's it.

**Realistic projections:**

**Year 1:**
- Need 10K+ page views/month for ads to matter
- 500 users × 5 searches = 2,500 views/month
- £8 CPM × 2.5 = £20/month = **£240/year**

**If traffic grows:**
- 2,000 users × 5 searches = 10,000 views/month
- £10 CPM × 10 = £100/month = **£1,200/year**

**Implementation:**
- Month 6: Set up Google AdSense (when you have 1K+ users)
- Add 2-3 non-intrusive placements
- A/B test positioning
- Done.

### Bonus: Sponsored Placements (if you get lucky)

**Only if you hit 5K+ users:**
- Email hotels: "£200/month to be featured"
- Email tour companies: "£100/month for banner"
- Direct deals, no middleman

**Potential:** £500-2,000/month

**Don't count on this.** It's a bonus if it happens.

- Write more SEO content (if it's driving traffic)

---

## Months 12-18: Exit Strategy

### Option 1: Sell to an OTA
**If you have 5K+ users and some revenue:**

**Who to approach:**
- Skyscanner (they acquire comparison tools)
- Booking.com (expanding into flights)
- Kayak (owned by Booking Holdings)
- Momondo (flight meta-search)

**Pitch:**
- "I have 10K users searching for group travel flights"
- "Group fairness is unique, no one else has it"
- "£5K/year in affiliate revenue, growing"
- "Want to buy it before AI agents commoditize?"

**Target price:** £20K-50K (3-10x annual revenue)

**Timing:** Month 12-15 (before AI agents launch)

### Option 2: Passive Income Stream
**If affiliate revenue is steady (£200-500/month):**

- Maintenance mode (1-2 hours/month)
- Keep collecting affiliate commissions
- Run until AI agents kill it (12-24 months)
- **Total: £5K-15K over 2 years**

### Option 3: Sell Domain + Traffic
**If it didn't monetize but has traffic:**

- Sell on Flippa.com or similar
- Domain might be worth £2K-5K
- Traffic worth £5-10 per monthly visitor
- **Total: £3K-10K**

### Option 4: Shut Down
**If it's not working by Month 12:**

- Accept the loss (£1K-3K)
- Archive the code
- Keep domain (might be valuable later)
- Write a postmortem
- Move on to next project

**Cost of learning:** £1K-3K + 200-400 hours

## What NOT to Build

Since you have 12-18 months max, **cut ruthlessly:**

### ❌ Don't Build:

1. **Subscription system** (Stripe, billing, etc.)
   - Why: Complex, wrong model for low-frequency use
   - Time saved: 40-60 hours

2. **User accounts with backend**
   - Why: Can use localStorage for saved trips
   - Time saved: 20-30 hours
   - Exception: Super simple email-only auth (10 hours max)

3. **Price tracking/alerts**
   - Why: Complex infrastructure, low value in short term
   - Time saved: 40-80 hours

4. **Perfect architecture refactoring**
   - Why: Won't matter in 18 months
   - Time saved: 40-60 hours

5. **Comprehensive test suite**
   - Why: Move fast, fix bugs as they come
   - Time saved: 30-50 hours

6. **Email marketing automation**
   - Why: Manual emails are fine for small scale
   - Time saved: 20-30 hours

7. **Analytics dashboards**
   - Why: Google Analytics is enough
   - Time saved: 20-40 hours

8. **B2B/Team features**
   - Why: Takes too long to sell
   - Time saved: 60-100 hours

9. **Multi-language/i18n**
   - Why: Not enough time for ROI
   - Time saved: 40-80 hours

10. **Anything taking >2 weeks**
    - Why: Time is your most limited resource

**Total time saved: 350-620 hours** (use this for growth & marketing instead!)

### ✅ Do Build (Essentials Only):

1. **Core fairness search** (you have this!)
2. **Mobile-responsive** (must-have)
3. **Affiliate "Book Now" buttons**
4. **Google AdSense integration**
5. **Basic SEO** (meta tags, sitemap)
6. **Share links** (viral growth)
7. **Simple saved trips** (localStorage)

**Total build time: 40-80 hours** (everything else is marketing/growth)

## The Brutal Truth

### Why This Might Fail:

1. **Affiliate programs reject you** (low traffic)
2. **No one books through your links** (2% conversion is optimistic)
3. **Can't get users** (SEO takes 12 months, ads are expensive)
4. **AI agents launch sooner** (12 months instead of 18)
5. **You get bored/busy** (side projects are hard to sustain)
6. **Market too small** (how many people plan group trips?)

### Why It Might Work:

1. **You have unique value prop** (fairness for groups)
2. **Low costs** (£500-2K, can afford to experiment)
3. **Simple monetization** (just affiliate links, no complexity)
4. **Time-limited = urgency** (forces you to ship fast)
5. **Multiple exits** (sell, passive income, or learning)
6. **Viral potential** (groups share with each other)

### Should You Do This?

**Yes, if:**
- You have 200-400 hours over next 12 months
- You can afford to lose £1K-3K
- You enjoy building and shipping products
- £5K-10K would be meaningful to you
- You want to learn growth/marketing
- You're treating this as a side project, not life mission

**No, if:**
- You value your time at £50+/hour
- You can't afford to lose £1K-3K
- You need revenue in 3 months to survive
- You'd be devastated if it fails
- You hate marketing/content creation
- You want a "real business," not side hustle

## Summary: The Realistic Path

**Month 1-3:** Ship fast with affiliate links
**Month 4-6:** Get to 1,000 users, optimize conversions

**Realistic outcome:** £5K-10K profit over 18 months

**Pessimistic outcome:** -£1K loss, learning experience

**Optimistic outcome:** £50K-100K acquisition by OTA

**Expected value:** £3K-8K (worth it if you enjoy the journey)
